<ul>MATLAB</ul>
<ol>My work on MATLAB goes from extracting sheets of infomation that containg the progress of the Puertorican Electric Power restoration after Hurricane Maria in where to categorize the data by city, population, the amount of power restored, how much till they restore all of the power and date. Then sorted by with city has the most power to the least.
<br><br>
In addition we extracted data and complied it into a 25 by 25 matrix in where we analyse the information to create a 3D graph for an analysis of quantity and depth of field.</ol>
<ul>Python</ul>
<ol>With my time in Python I have been able to make navigation menus for convertion tools and procedures, created a navigation tool for train travel between states using the Dijisktra algorthimn in order to find the shortest path between stations with the help of a predetermined weighted graph with lenght, parent and child nodes. As well used algorithms to analyse matrixies of data.</ol>
<ul>HTML, CSS and Javascript</ul>
<ol>I've designed this website with pure CSS, HTML and Javascript. In order to provide access to recluiters for potential intership or COOP opportunities. Before that this domain used to be where I would share my digital creative stories and poems such as Twines, my Twitter bot and auto-generating poems. However the site the site has evolved into final project for my Web Design class.</ol>
<ul>Java</ul>
<ol>I've worked in collaboration with partners in order to modify video games with a focus on functionality, efficienty and overall experience in games such as MegaMan, Snake and 2D Magika. As well to come up with solutions to common world problems in order to make life easier in both a scientify and everyday use.</ol>
<ul>AutoCAD</ul>
<ol>I've made 3D renders of houses, arcs, streets, as well as a variety of products. There include drawing elipse, arcs, eliptic paraboloids and others.</ol>
<ul>App Development</ul>
<ol>Worked on an Health App for Android User, that would store personal information such as medical and personal information. The app would store the data and if decided you could send that information to your doctor through a text message or any other third party app. As well as some other Android Apps with the help from the App Inventor Tool.</ol>
